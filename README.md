# DwarfExample
Our client “Sundown Boulevard” have asked us to build a booking system for their tables in the restaurant. The
restaurant is open from 16:00 – 22:00 every day (don’t take into account bank holidays and weekends etc.)
The restaurant have 10 tables where two people can sit at each table. The tables can be put together in order to
accommodate larger bookings.

##The system should be able to:
Allow users to book tables in a restaurant, min 2 persons max 10, per booking
* Each user should be authenticated by using their email as unique identifier when making a booking
* They should be able to book in time slots of two hours
* The user need pick a drink from this drinks menu https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2, when making a
booking
* The user also needs to pick a random dish from
here https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php, when making a booking
* It’s important that the users don’t know where the dish and drink data is coming from when booking a table
The interface for the bookings is completely up to you to decide. (API based, simple HTML page with some buttons,
Admin Panel based etc.)
